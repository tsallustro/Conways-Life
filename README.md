# Conways-Life
My Implementation of Conway's Game of Life

This program is my implementation of Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a simple chaotic 
automation that defines cells in a grid as either alive (black) or dead (white). The program observes the following rules:

-Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
-Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
-All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
